        <p>My name is Tim Broeker, and I'm the technical director at Electric Citizen.
        Electric Citizen is a Minneapolis-based web agency, and we work almost
        exclusively in the civic sector (this includes everything from nonprofits and
            mission-driven organizations to higher ed and government work.)</p>
        <p>A big part of my life involves this idea of data integrations, and helping
            organizations solve some pretty difficult problems that all surround
            this idea of data integration, and figuring out better ways of getting data from "here
            to there."
        </p>
            <p>We recently worked with the Wilder Foundation on one of these integration projects,
                and we are fortunate to have Bryan Lloyd here with us from Wilder, who is going to help provide some
                perspective from their end of the equation as we explore some of these ideas,
                and some of the lessons we learned along the way. Bryan why don't you go ahead
                and introduce yourself before we dive in...

        <p>Before we jump right into talking about data integrations, I think it is important to provide some context, and to
        give a brief overview of how a "typical" nonprofit website looks like in 2019 from high level.</p>
        <p>Websites usually have different levels of complexity, depending on your goals and your budget and your resources</p>
        <p>The typical starting point, or what I'll call level one, looks something like this...</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Most nonprofits treat their website as command central, and as their main public face to the world</p>
        <p>Most of them are now running on some type of CMS like Drupal or Wordpress or some other system</p>
        <p>Most them are doing a good job covering the basics</p>
        <p>(perhaps some of them are struggling with accessibility and responsiveness...)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Most sites also pretty quickly move on to Level Two which I call psuedo integrations, with things like Google Analytics
            and basic social media integrations</p>
        <p>But at this level we are not talking about real data integrations (despite what many RFPs seem to indicate!)</p>
        <p>Instead this often means a very simple integration like Google Analytics, or things like iframe embeds, links off to other sites,
            and so on [COVER SLIDE]</p>
        <p>If your stops at level two, you can probably get away with something like Squarespace or Wix or a simple Wordpress install</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Level three is where things start to get really interesting, and this is the kind of work that gets me really excited and where Drupal really starts to shine</p>
        <p>Most organizations have one or more unique needs, or some type of custom data or application (and as we'll see in a bit, wilder's research library is a great example)</p>
        <p>Typically these are NEW tools or applications that are going to make things easier or better in some way,
            or to provide some critical resource or tool to an audience. [COVER SLIDE]</p>
        <p>I love creating solutions for things like this, but in the vast majority of cases, we are still
            working directly within the CMS, or building something "new" within it...and often there is no real integration necessary</p>

    <h6 style="margin-top: 1em;" class="gold">LEVEL FOUR</h6>
<h4>To infinity...and beyond!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Third party integrations (e.g. SaaS)</li>
        <li>Legacy integrations (e.g. homegrown apps)</li>
        <li>Public data integrations (e.g. data.gov)</li>
        <li>Any kind of integration!</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>And then we get to level four, which is really what the rest of this session will focus on and where things start to
        get really interesting and complicated</p>
        <p>Here we talking about TRUE data integrations, which typically involve an API, or some type of external data source
            where two systems are talking together [COVER SLIDE]</p>
        <p>The "data" in question can really come from anywhere, and often there are multiple sources</p>
        <p>The vast majority of our client projects now include some of integration like this, and we have learned
        that ALL of them are challenging, and every single one is a bit different</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>So as we mentioned, we're going to use our recent project with the Wilder Foundation to guide
            us through how this kind of integration can work
        </p>
        <p>This slide is from the original RFP we received from Wilder [READ IT]</p>
        <p>So we had never heard of InMagic, and this kind of line item in an RFP often strikes fear in our hearts</p>
        <p>There are always a lot of unknowns, and we often have to provide a bid before we know all of the details</p>
        <p>If you can figure out a way to do paid discovery process BEFORE having your vendor bid on your project, do it!</p>
        <p>Now let's turn things over to Brian to talk a bit about Wilder and their research library</p>
