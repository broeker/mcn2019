        <p>My name is Tim Broeker, and I'm the technical director at Electric Citizen.
        Electric Citizen is a Minneapolis-based web agency, and we work almost
        exclusively in the civic sector (this includes everything from nonprofits and
            mission-driven organizations to higher ed and government work.)</p>
        <p>A big part of my life involves this idea of data integrations, and helping
            organizations solve some pretty difficult problems that all surround
            this idea of data integration, and figuring out better ways of getting data from "here
            to there."
        </p>
            <p>We recently worked with the Wilder Foundation on one of these integration projects,
                and we forutnate to have Bryan Lloyed here with us from Wilder, who is going to help provide some
                perspective from their end of the equation as we explore some of these ideas,
                and some of the lessons we learned along the way. Bryan why don't you go ahead
                and introduce yourself before we dive in...

        <p>Before we jump right into talking about data integrations, I think it is important to provide some context, and to
        give a brief overview of how a "typical" nonprofit website looks like in 2019 from high level.</p>
        <p>Websites usually go through a few phases over time that might look something like this...</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Most nonprofits treat their website as command central, and as their main public face to the world</p>
        <p>Most of these websites are now running on some type of CMS</p>
        <p>And most  them are doing a good job covering the basics of messaging</p>
        <p>(perhaps some of them are struggling with accessibility and responsiveness...)</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Most sites also pretty quickly move on to Level Two, with Google Analytics and basic social media integrations</p>
        <p>But at this level we are not looking true data integrations (despite what many RFPs seem to indicate!)</p>
        <p>Instead this often means a very simple integration like Google Analytics, or things like iframe embeds, links off to other sites, and so on</p>

        <p>Level three is where things start to get really interesting, and this is the kind of work that gets me really excited...</p>
        <p>Most organizations have one or more very unique needs, or some type of custom data or application (and as we'll see in a bit, wilder's research library is a great example)</p>
        <p>Typically these are tools or applications that are going to make things easier or better, or to provide some critical resource or tool to an audience.</p>
        <p>I love creating solutions for things like this, but in the vast majority of cases, we are still working directly within the CMS, or building something "new" within it</p>

    <h6 style="margin-top: 1em;" class="gold">LEVEL FOUR</h6>
<h4>To infinity...and beyond!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Third party integrations (e.g. SaaS)</li>
        <li>Legacy integrations (e.g. homegrown apps)</li>
        <li>Public data integrations (e.g. data.gov)</li>
        <li>Any kind of integration!</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>And then we get to level four, which is really what the rest of this session will focus on</p>
        <p>Here we get start talking about true data integrations, which typically involve an API or some type of custom importer
            where two systems are talking together and sharing data back and forth</p>
        <p>The "data" in question can really come from anywhere, and often there are multiple sources</p>
        <p>The vast majority of our client projects now include some of integration like this, and we have learned
        that every single one is a bit different</p>

        <p>So as we mentioned, we're going to be using a recent project for the Wilder Foundation to show you
        the different steps in the process, some of the key things we learned, and some general tips for how
        to best think about and plan for these types of integrations</p>
        <p>This slide is from the original RFP, and it describes the project in just a few words (read)</p>
        <p>We had never heard of InPresto, and this kind of line item in an RFP often strikes fear in our heart
        because it immediately becomes a giant unknown that can be very difficult to estimate</p>
