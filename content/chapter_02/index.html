    <img src="includes/planning.png" width="60%"/>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>So all of our projects typically include a general "planning and discovery" phase, but a big integration
        project will typically require its own dedicated discovery process</p>
        <p>It will be a lot of work and sometimes pretty painful</p>
        <p>This slide shows some of our original Basecamps posts, Google Docs, and system documentation from InMagic</p>
        <p>This stage took several weeks, and involved a lot of posts, and back and forth with Wilder and InMagic</p>
        <p></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Confirm the exact goals and requirements</li>
        <li>Is there an API available? How does it look?</li>
        <li>What about exposed data? (XML, CSV, JSON)</li>
        <li>What documentation is available?</li>
        <li>Is it better or possible to just rebuild?</li>
        <li>Ask and re-ask/Read and re-read</li>
        <li>Select your tools and approach (e.g. Migrate API)</li>
        <li>Are the estimates still accurate?</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>In this stage, we learned pretty early on that the available API integration was going to be a herculean task
        (dedicated Windows server, which REALLY did not want to do this for our sake and for Wilder's sake </p>
        <p>In an early meeting, we asked if there also might be some kind of export functionality that might
            expose the data in a machine readable format</p>
        <p>It turns out there was, and we immediately re-focused our discovery on this process</p>
        <p>This phase involved Wilder quite heavily in terms of effort and hours</p>
        <p>By the end of discovery we had a pretty clear path forward, with a fairly high degree of confidence that it would work</p>

        <h3 class="gold">Step two: design and document</h3>
    <img src="includes/design.png" width="60%"/>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Once we had eliminated most of the unknowns during discovery, it was time to move into the design phase</p>
        <p>Unlike the discovery phase, this is where we really start getting deep into the details and documentating everything down to the field level </p>
        <p>During this stage, every detail matters</p>
        <p>It is time to be specific, and to understand, and to write it down</p>

 <ul>
     <li>Data analysis and documenation (InMagic)</li>
     <li>Content model documentation (Drupal)</li>
     <li>Experimentation and validation</li>
     <li>More experimentation and validation!</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>This phase also involved multiple members of the Wilder team and lots of back and forth, reviewing
        and commenting on living documentation</p>
        <p>This phase is really about getting all of your ducks in a row, and documenting everything from what tools you
        use to exactly how the external data will mapped to your website [COVER SLIDE]</p>
        <p>We often build small proof-of-concepts during this phase also, just to make sure we are still on the right path</p>

    <h3 class="gold">Step three: build</h3>
    <img src="includes/building.png" width="60%"/>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>With a fully documented plan in hand, it is finally time to move into the build phase</p>
        <p>Wilder's involvement dropped off a bit during this phase, but they were still quite heavily involved, working with InMagic to make changes
        to data, and working with us to verify assumptions</p>
        <p>There were definitely changes even with careful planning and documentation during the earlier phases</p>

<section data-background-image="includes/simplecloud.svg">
<ul>
        <li>Implement content model and views (Drupal)</li>
        <li>Implement API client or automated export (InMagic)</li>
        <li>Implement API consumer or automated imports (Drupal)</li>
        <li>Iterate as needed</li>
        <li>Testing and QA</li>

        <p>With a good plan and good documentation, the actual build phase should be fairly straight forward [COVER SLIDE]</p>
        <p>But even the best laid plans are no guarantee for an easy path! </p>
        <p>We'll talk more about some of our specific struggles in a bit but for now, success!</p>

        <p>Success!</p>
        <p>In the end, we have a 100% automated, fully integrated system...</p>
        <p>we have data going into InMagic, followed by automated exports
            which are then followed by automated imports into Drupal</p>
        <p>And at the end of the day we end up with a pretty powerful tool...</p>
        <p>you can visit the wilder site any time to see it in action
            but here are a few highlights of how the tools ended up</p>
