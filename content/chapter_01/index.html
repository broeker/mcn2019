        <p>Wilder Foundation, since 1906, has had a mission to promote the
        social welfare of persons resident or located in the greater Saint Paul
        metropolitan area by all appropriate means. So, we have a local geographic
        focus where we need to create impact, an opportunity to do this work for the
        benefit of all and though an evolving set of means and actions.
        </p>
        <p>
        When it comes to disseminating our Research work, our public web site has
        become the core means by which we accomplish this. It is simply the best tool we
        have for getting Wilder's body of research and analysis of evidence-based practices
        into the hands of those who might put this information to use within our region and beyond.

            Wilder Research has been creating community impact through person-focused research
            since 1917. In fact, our very first study that year influenced policy change towards
            healthier living conditions for residents of St. Paul. In more recent times, maybe 20
            years ago, we started creating our first digital catalog of reports and publications
            as desktop publishing software came into use. We used a desktop library software
            from InMagic called DB/TextWorks. When our first website was developed we then began
            to copy information and files there for those few early adopters of dial-up internet to discover.
        Over the years, and through several InMagic software upgrades and wilder.org redesign
            projects, we found ourselves largely still at a point where we were copying data and
            files into fairly general purpose web content systems, for what had become basically
            everyone with a computer or mobile device. We owed it to ourselves and our stakeholders
            to do something better.

        <small>So again, we first started using desktop software from InMagic to manage our catalog back before the year 2000. It proved to be an effective and powerful tool for managing and searching though our growing body of work, but it was mainly used by our Librarians. By around 2005, we installed a web publisher component that allowed for viewing the data via web browser. We ran this as an internal only service though, so while it allowed for a loose integration with our department's intranet and increased staff access, website visitors were still only getting manually duplicated data from content management systems that were not necessarily built to manage them well. In addition, we were managing multiple subsets of data in different places, in order to target different audiences or restrict permissions to certain content. This is how we operated for 3 iterations of wilder.org. Finally, a few years ago we decided it was time to upgrade to the SaaS version of InMagic Presto. In addition to consolidating all of the data, permissions, and access into one tool, this opened the door for the online data integration with Drupal on the wilder.org that we have today.</small>

    How we got from here to there<br /> and lived to tell about it.

        Okay, thank you Bryan! From here we will sort of walk through our journey together, and
        try to explore some of the challenges we faced and how we got from here to there
        </p>
        <p>Every single one of these integrations is different and have unique challenges, but hopefully these next
        few slides will give a good picture of the work involved and how you might approach a similar challenge
